## Core Features & Technical Highlights üéØ

*   **Dynamic Story Creation & Viewing:** Users can upload images, which are processed (resized, converted to base64) and displayed as auto-playing stories with individual progress indicators.
*   **Interactive Navigation:** Implements intuitive swipe (via `react-swipeable`) and click-based navigation through story sequences.
*   **Client-Side Persistence & Expiry:** Leverages Browser LocalStorage for storing stories and managing their 24-hour lifecycle entirely on the client.
*   **Responsive UI:** Crafted with CSS3 for a seamless experience across various devices.
*   **Modern Frontend Stack:** Built with **React.js** (Hooks), **JavaScript (ES6+)**, and styled with **CSS3**, all bundled efficiently using **Vite**.
*   **Key Functionalities:** Includes story deletion, visual distinction between viewed/unviewed stories, and robust error handling for image processing.
